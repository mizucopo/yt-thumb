# Git Flow

- main: Production
- develop: Development
- feature/*: Features (branch from develop, merge to develop)
- release/*: Not used
- hotfix/*: Not used

## Workflow
git checkout develop && git pull
git checkout -b feature/*
gh pr create --base develop

## Quality Check
uv run task test

## Code Organization Rules
- 1 file = 1 class
- 1 class = 1 test file
- When fixing linting errors, modify only the affected code files - never modify pyproject.toml configuration.

## Testing Guidelines (Strict Adherence)
- **Framework**: Use function-based tests (pytest), not class-based.
- **Language**: Write all test comments (especially AAA steps) and docstrings in Japanese to clarify the test intent.
- **Strategy**: Test "What" (observable behavior/results), not "How" (implementation details). Avoid verifying internal method call counts or execution order.
- **Mocking**: Minimize mocks. Use real instances for domain logic; mock only uncontrolled external boundaries (DB, API, SMTP).
- **Architecture**: Separate domain logic from IO. Refactor to Humble Object/Hexagonal patterns if needed to ensure logic is testable without IO.
- **Structure**:
  - Use **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert) with explicit comments.
  - Naming: Describe business requirements (e.g., `sum_of_two_numbers_returns_total_value`), not method names.
- **Scope**: Never test private methods directly. Cover them indirectly via public interfaces.
